Hi. It's been a while. It wasn't for no reason though, I was busy, like properly busy. A lot has happened since the last time I wrote, but the biggest event in recent days was the new year, and while I know that it's a bit late by now, I want to say a happy new year to all of us. May this year be even better than last year. 

2019 was... well, let's just say that it has its ups and downs. Too many things happened in 2019. I made a super lengthy Twitter thread (https://twitter.com/Adit_Raharditya by the way) about 2019 so I'm not gonna repeat it here again. But the point is, apart from what I feel about last year, 2019 was definitely a transformative year for me. ...

The list starts with something obvious for me. So in December last year, me and a few of my friends made this thing called DM Creative. It's supposed to be something like a production house, where we take jobs from clients with tasks ranging from photo shoots to graphic design. This is basically a continuation of the work that I've done for the organization and events that I've participated in, but this time I'm actually getting paid for my work. This is something that I've been wanting to do ever since I applied to be in Medinfo department for my organization in semester 1. I've talked to my friends about doing this for years and now it's finally happening. The "DM" stands for "Digital Memories" by the way. Yeah, I know. Not the best name ever. I didn't like it, but the more I say it, the more it becomes.. just okay. Anyway, DM is still in its early stage. It's not even a month old by now. We don't have much to boast on our Instagram profile, so everytime we land on a gig, that will certainly be our promotion material as well. And we did, actually, had a gig. Twice, even. We established DM just 3 days before my uni's graduation, hoping that we'll find someone who want to hire photographer to shoot their moments and stuff. We knew that it was too close to the graduation, so if no one hired us, we would just show up there and take photos of people to put as our promotion material. This is also why I was okay with our name being the way it is, because we were so close to the graduation and that was our moment to start this. We had everything, all but a name, so we settled on that. As it turned out, one if our guy has a friend that was about to graduate and wanted to rent cameras to take good photos. He offered to hire us instead, and he did. That was our first gig and first time experience of working with a client, and it went great. 

The next on the list is my internship. My uni, just like most universities here, requires their student to take ... This, just like DM, also started in 2019. It was a time when people around me, I included, was really busy with this event called Admi. ...

The last thing probably is my thesis and everything that comes with it, that is me probably bashing my head against my desk, me frantically looking for a title for my thesis, and endless wave of revision that will feel like it'll never end. Honesly man, I don't know. It's hard to believe that the end of my college life will end so soon. I can't fathom that by the end of this year I'm expected to have my thesis all formed and partially written. I mean like, I don't even know what I've learnt all these years, goddamnit. I have no passion over politics, nor do I have passion for fucking public policy shit. So yeah, all that being said, I don't think I'm ready. But then again, I don't think I'll ever be ready, so I don't know. Just writing this make me remember how scary the future is, the uncertainty. Anyway, it's something that I have to deal with, so that I will do. I just don't know how I'll be able to do it. I have absolutely no idea what case or title I'm going to make as my thesis title, but I hope that it will change soon enough. Wish me luck anyway. After all, luck may be the only thing I need to get through this. 

Anyway, that bit about my thesis caught me off guard a bit, so let's shift the atmorphere a bit by talking about movies and series I look forward to in 2020. A lot has ended in 2019 in terms of series. The biggest for me are Game of Thrones and Mr Robot. Game of Thrones was, well, you all read the internet. You know how it ended, and just how bad it was. Tell you what, man, try comparing the latest seasons of GOT with earlier seasons of GOT, it'll feel like you're watching an entirely different series. I think that GOT's ending was the worst thing that could happen to a series, especially considering how good it was a few years back. Mr Robot, however, did a fantastic job at ending the show. Mr Robot is a series that I've watched live since its first season. I experienced the full 5 years of watching and waiting through the season hiatus until its finale and let me tell you, it was an experience no other series could give. The series is so bizzare, but in a good way, and realistic, even too realistic sometimes that it seems to have predicted some real life events. This series affected me, changed the way that I see storytelling, changed my mind about what's good and what's bad to do in a series, even inspired me to apply their weird framing technique into the photos that I take. This series is very good, and it ended perfectly. But enough of stuff that's over last year, it's not what this post is for anyway. For 2020, I only look forward to two things, really. Those are Tenet and Westworld Season 3. ...

Last thing is, well, what kind of new year blog post is it without a new year resolution, right? My resolutions are simple, to be better than last year. I need to worry less, because experience says that that won't do anyone any good in almost any scenario. I need to respect other people more, answer their chat immediately, instead of just reading and never reply to them. I need to socialize better. It's been my issue for as long as I can remember, you could argue that it's just my personality to have a harder time socializing than other people. I've forced myself to socialize for a while now, and most of the time it worked out fine, but lately I feel like it's too tiring to do that. I'm starting to let go of friends that I used to be close to. I don't show up nearly enough when they hang out anymore. I'm afraid that I'll just end up alone, all by myself,having no one or nowhere to go to. So yeah. Other than stuff from inside my mind, I also need to look after my physical body. I need to excercise more. I've been spending too much time staring at my PC, and I know that's not healty. At least I've made some progress on this part though, as I just did jogging this evening. And it wasn't bad either, considering I haven't jog for a whole year until today. Oh, and my last resolution is to get myself a camera. If I'm serious with DM, then at least I've got to make some investment to it. Just so you know, I just build a new PC two months ago, and that's exactly what I need for now. I could use this PC for stuff related to DM as well, since I now can edit videos and stuff much faster compared to my laptop, but I think that I still need to get myself a camera since I don't have one. My bank account is still in a phase of recovery, though, since I spend almost all of my money on this PC. I don't regret it, but now I'm on my way to saving money to get a camera, so wish me luck. 

So I think that that's enough for now. This post is already the longest post I've ever posted on this blog, and I'm kind of gotten tired of rambling by now. I'm just excited for this year and all the possibilities that lies in it. This year will also host one of the hardest exam that I can imagine, that is the final thesis, so I wish myself that I get lucky when dealing with that. That being said, I hope that 2020 will bring good stuff to all of us. Till next time!
